measure used for all the models:  -siloutte + SSW normalized by the overall variance (SSW is between 0 and 1)

models based on all the features

Kmean
	Optimizer (Grids Search)
	Elbow (with the parames from Optimzer, checking for different clusters)
	Decision: Best number of cluster, params, and business Point of View

Agglomerate
	Optimizer (Grids Search)
	Elbow (with the parames from Optimzer, checking for different clusters)
	Dendogram
	Decision: Best number of cluster and params (based on the dendogram gain/cost), and business Point of View

Overall Business Decision
	Choose the best algorithm  bsed on lowest number of cluster and measures from above models. 
		and Based on Business Point of View.
	Which number of cluster make more sense from a business stand point? 
	Show one HeatMap
	Define the differnt clusters in English



TO DO:
- Update the library to pass custom params to the model (Nikhil) Done
- Update the MaxV3 code (Max) 
- Meet to define the English version of the clusters (All)
- Fill the MD First draft (All)
- Review and clean MD/Notebook (All)
